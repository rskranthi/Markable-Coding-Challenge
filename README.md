This challenge was part of interview process with Markable

The Following are the Instructions regarding the project.

Markable Coding Challenge (Spring Boot):

The Following are the initial configuration to be made to ensure that the app runs smoothly.
1.	Create a Database Schema named messages
2.	Change the username and password fields in the application.properties file under src/main/resources to the host db username and password.
3.	Ensure that Maven is installed.
4.	Download the file as zip and unzip it.
5.	Import it as an Existing Maven project
6.	Update the Maven Project to ensure all the dependencies exist.
7.	Run the project as a spring boot application
8.	Check results

The Following is the time spent on each of the tasks
1.	Getting better idea of spring boot project structure and applications – 2 hours
2.	Design of the Project – 30 mins
3.	Coding of all the components – 4-5 hours
4.	Issues were encountered with environment, bean configuration, autowiring, scheduling. I have spent around 12 hours on fixing other issues along with these issues.
5.	Testing of the project with various inputs – 2 hours
6.	Tidying up the code – 1 hour
Sample application.properties file :
spring.datasource.url= jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/messages
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=X9pgptjaud6@

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update


The Project was a great learning experience and challenging one. I was able to apply the concepts I learnt hands on. I believe I could do more of such interesting projects with Amazing people at Markable.
